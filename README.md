# Predicting hotel room location, based on WiFi signal strength

The setup consists of 4 hotel rooms and 7 WiFi access points. All the 7 WiFi APs are accessible from each room, but with different signal strengths. The signal strengths are in dBm. 

The task is to train a model which can accurately predict the room number, given the strengths of WiFi signals from all the seven APs.
